# Weaviate Connector

To create a `weaviate_connector.py` script that defines Pydantic classes for the inputs and outputs required by the `weaviate_datastore.py` functions, you can start by examining the key functionalities in `weaviate_datastore.py`. This includes operations like upserting documents, querying, and deleting data. Then, define corresponding Pydantic models to structure the data for these operations.

Here’s an example to get you started:

### weaviate_connector.py

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Define Pydantic models for input and output data structures

class DocumentMetadata(BaseModel):
    document_id: str
    source: Optional[str]
    source_id: Optional[str]
    url: Optional[str]
    created_at: Optional[str]
    author: Optional[str]

class DocumentChunk(BaseModel):
    chunk_id: str
    text: str
    metadata: DocumentMetadata

class QueryWithEmbedding(BaseModel):
    query: str
    embedding: List[float]
    top_k: Optional[int] = 10
    filter: Optional[DocumentMetadata] = None

class DocumentChunkWithScore(BaseModel):
    id: str
    text: str
    score: float
    metadata: DocumentMetadata

class QueryResult(BaseModel):
    query: str
    results: List[DocumentChunkWithScore]

# Data class for the actual data
@dataclass
class DocumentData:
    chunk_id: str
    document_id: str
    text: str
    source: Optional[str]
    source_id: Optional[str]
    url: Optional[str]
    created_at: Optional[str]
    author: Optional[str]
    embedding: List[float]

# Other necessary models and data classes as required by the functions in weaviate_datastore.py
```

### Explanation:

1. **DocumentMetadata**: This Pydantic model is for the metadata of each document or chunk. It includes fields like `document_id`, `source`, etc.

2. **DocumentChunk**: Represents a chunk of a document, containing the text and its metadata.

3. **QueryWithEmbedding**: Used for querying with embeddings. It contains the query text, embedding array, and optional top_k and filter parameters.

4. **DocumentChunkWithScore**: This model represents a document chunk along with a relevance score, useful for query results.

5. **QueryResult**: A model for the result of a query, containing the query text and a list of `DocumentChunkWithScore`.

6. **DocumentData** (dataclass): This represents the actual data structure for a document chunk, used for more convenient data handling within Python code.

Each model is designed to facilitate the structured data flow in and out of the Weaviate datastore functions. You can expand these models based on the specific requirements of your `weaviate_datastore.py`. 

Remember to import these models in your `weaviate_datastore.py` and adapt the existing code to use these structured inputs and outputs for better type safety and clarity.

# MinIO Connector

To implement a similar setup for MinIO integration as we did for Weaviate, we can define Pydantic models and data classes that correspond to the operations you’ll be performing with MinIO, such as uploading, downloading, and managing objects in buckets. These models will help in structuring the input and output data for interactions with MinIO.

### minio_connector.py

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass
import datetime

# Define Pydantic models for MinIO operations

class MinioObjectMetadata(BaseModel):
    object_name: str
    bucket_name: str
    size: Optional[int] = None
    last_modified: Optional[datetime.datetime] = None
    content_type: Optional[str] = None

class MinioUploadRequest(BaseModel):
    bucket_name: str
    object_name: str
    file_path: str  # Local path to the file to be uploaded

class MinioDownloadRequest(BaseModel):
    bucket_name: str
    object_name: str
    destination_path: str  # Local path where the file will be downloaded

class MinioDeleteRequest(BaseModel):
    bucket_name: str
    object_name: str

# Data class for actual MinIO object data
@dataclass
class MinioObjectData:
    object_name: str
    bucket_name: str
    data: bytes
    metadata: Optional[MinioObjectMetadata] = None

# Other necessary models as required for MinIO operations
```

### Explanation:

1. **MinioObjectMetadata**: This model represents the metadata of an object stored in MinIO. It includes the object name, bucket name, size, last modified date, and content type.

2. **MinioUploadRequest**: Used for uploading files to MinIO. It contains the bucket name, object name, and the local file path of the file to upload.

3. **MinioDownloadRequest**: For downloading files from MinIO. It includes the bucket and object names, and the local destination path.

4. **MinioDeleteRequest**: Represents a request to delete an object from MinIO, specifying the bucket and object names.

5. **MinioObjectData** (dataclass): This data class represents the actual data of a MinIO object, including its name, bucket, and the data itself (as bytes).

These models will provide a structured way to handle data for operations with MinIO in your Python code. You can extend or modify these models based on the specific requirements of your MinIO operations. 

In your implementation, these models will be used to pass data to and from functions that interact with the MinIO SDK, ensuring a consistent and type-safe approach to handling object storage operations.
