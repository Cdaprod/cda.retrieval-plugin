Creating `minio_datastore.py` involves writing a Python class that interacts with a MinIO server for operations like uploading, downloading, and managing objects in buckets. This class should follow the same modular approach and functionality as `weaviate_datastore.py`. Below is an example implementation:

### minio_datastore.py

Below is a complete implementation of `minio_datastore.py`, using the MinIO Python SDK with correct methods and detailed docstrings:

### minio_datastore.py

```python
from minio import Minio
from minio.error import S3Error

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from typing import List


class MinioDataStore:

    def delete_object(self, bucket_name: str, object_name: str) -> None:

#### Example usage to initialize MinioDataStore class
# minio_store = MinioDataStore()

#### Example usage for individual upload_object download_object delete_object functions
# minio_store.upload_object('my-bucket', 'my-object', '/path/to/myfile')
# minio_store.download_object('my-bucket', 'my-object', '/path/to/download')
# minio_store.delete_object('my-bucket', 'my-object')

#### Example usage to print list of 'object_names'
# object_names = minio_store.list_objects('my-bucket')
# print(object_names)
```

### Notes:
- **Environment Variables**: The class uses environment variables for MinIO configuration, ensuring secure access to credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included, capturing `S3Error` exceptions. This should be expanded for more specific error handling and logging in a production environment.
- **Secure Connection**: The `secure` parameter in the Minio client is set based on your server configuration (HTTP or HTTPS).

This class provides a complete interface for MinIO operations like upload, download, and delete, following best practices for configuration and error handling. You can further expand these methods based on your specific requirements.

### Documentation

The `MinioDataStore` class provides a modular and straightforward interface to interact with a MinIO server. It encapsulates basic operations such as uploading, downloading, and deleting objects in a MinIO bucket. 

- **Initialization**: The `__init__` method sets up the MinIO client with necessary credentials and endpoint information. It establishes the connection to the MinIO server.

- **Uploading Objects**: The `upload_object` method uploads a file to the specified bucket in MinIO. It requires the bucket name, object name (key under which the file will be stored), and the local file path.

- **Downloading Objects**: The `download_object` method retrieves a file from MinIO and saves it to a specified path on the local file system.

- **Deleting Objects**: The `delete_object` method removes an object from the specified bucket.

Error handling is crucial when interacting with external services like MinIO. Each method in this implementation captures `S3Error` exceptions, which should be expanded upon based on your specific error handling and logging requirements.

This class can be extended with more functionalities such as bucket creation, object listing, and more advanced error handling as needed for your application. 

Always ensure that you handle sensitive information like access keys and secret keys securely, preferably using environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
